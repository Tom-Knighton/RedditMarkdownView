Overuse of persuasion mini-game instead of skill checks.|\n|[Digital Foundry (Performance based review)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlStOHRI56o)|Unscored|Consistent and stable experience on consoles with no obvious bugs.  Graphics are excellent with high detail and beautiful environmental  artwork. Game is smooth and stable with no glaring issues. Significant  improvements in graphics quality compared to Bethesda's previous games.  Xbox Series X and S both offer sharp and clean image quality. Motion  blur helps to smooth out the 30 FPS frame rate target. Combat feels  great, and main content of the game is in very good form.|World is segmented with frequent loading screens, interrupting the  experience. Planetary exploration can be repetitive due to procedurally  generated content. Framerate is locked at 30 FPS without higher frame  rate options. Some significant compromises in distant detail, shadows,  and reflections on Series S. Series S features softer shadow maps and  lower resolution cube maps for reflections. Occasionally, performance  issues in cities, particularly New Atlantis and Aquila. Procedurally  generated content lacks the curated experience of prior Bethesda games.  The motion blur effect might be too subtle for some players' preference.|\n|[JackFrags](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD7Oo58c5LE)|Unscored|Engaging gameplay with different aspects like mining, combat, and space  exploration. Detailed character creation and background choices.  Intriguing story elements and mysteries. Smooth transition between  planetary exploration and space travel. Tutorial system that introduces  gameplay mechanics step by step. Varied gameplay mechanics, from combat  to scanning creatures and resources. Atmospheric visuals and detailed  environments. Ability to customize and upgrade your ship's systems.  Multiple options for approaching encounters, including combat and  diplomacy. Seamless transition between first-person and third-person  perspectives. Interesting characters and interactions.|Some players might find the controls and mechanics overwhelming at  first. Initial learning curve for managing ship systems and combat  tactics. Some players might find the tutorial interruptions disrupt the  flow of the game. Scanning and surveying mechanics might become  repetitive over time. Initial interactions with some characters could  feel a bit rushed or forced. Some players might wish for more ship  customization options from the start. The transition between space and  planetary exploration is cinematic, not seamless. The UI can feel  cluttered and complex, especially for new players. Minor technical  issues could arise, such as frame rate drops or bugs. The initial  narrative pacing might not suit players looking for immediate action.  Not all players might enjoy the blend of first-person shooter and RPG  mechanics.|\n|[GmanLives](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVvHtVkRV8k)|Unscored|**Vast Exploration:** Expansive galaxy with diverse planets and systems. **Engaging Factions:** Join various factions, each with unique storylines. **Detailed Cities:** Well-designed and lively cities with NPCs and activities. **Comprehensive Customization:** Extensive character and ship customization options. **Immersive RPG Elements:** Deep role-playing mechanics and meaningful choices. **Rewarding Gameplay:** Rich missions, exploration, and crafting offer satisfaction. **Solid Voice Acting:** Voice talent adds depth to characters and narrative. **Atmospheric Graphics:** Visually appealing environments and space exploration.|**Occasional Bugs:** Some players experience technical glitches and bugs. **Limited Planetary Depth:** Planets can feel sparse with repetitive content. **Stamina Mechanic:** Oxygen and stamina limitations during planet exploration. **Procedural Planets:** Some planets lack unique details due to procedural generation. **Combat Mechanics:** Ground and space combat could be more refined. **Lacking Vehicle Travel:** No manual control during planetary entry or exit. **Mixed Voice Acting:** While solid, voice acting quality can vary. **Platform Exclusivity:** Limited availability on certain platforms (e.g., PC, Xbox).|\n|[JuiceHead](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05ccrMV40bQ)|Unscored|Engaging quests Extensive faction content Rich galaxy exploration Impressive shipbuilding Skill-based character growth|Repetitive random encounters Limited depth in quests Inconsistent  background impact Simplistic space combat Some generic structures|\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm trying to add as many as possible, but it takes some time, I may not get all of them!")
